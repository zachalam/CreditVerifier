## Start the app

To start the development backend server run `nx serve credit-verifier-backend`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

To start both frontend and backend run `npx nx run-many -t serve`. Frontend application will be running at `http://localhost:4200` and backend server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

Happy coding!

## Prerequisite

- Install Noir
    `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash`


## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.
